# **Company Permissions Policy**

### Purpose

The purpose of this sections is to outline the permissions and access controls in place within Invivo AX to ensure secure handling of sensitive information.

### Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to company systems, networks, or data.

### Permissions Hierarchy

| Permission Level | Description                                                            |

| **Employee**     | Regular staff members with limited access to company systems and data. |

### Access Control Procedures

---

- Initial Access: Employees and contractors are granted initial access through our standardized onboarding checklist, which is managed by the DevOps and Information Security (InfoSec) team.
- Access Requests: Employees can request additional permissions or access rights by submitting a formal request form (see Appendix).
- Revocation of Permissions: The Info sec team regularly audits permissions and their usage. Permissions will be immediately revoked upon employee separation or role change, as well as when permissions are no longer needed or used.
